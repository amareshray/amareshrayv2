I've now been using Hey.com for my emails for the past few months and I have to say that I haven't really missed Gmail.

However, what I have missed is being able to use Google calendar a good calendar integration. 

When people would send me invites to my hey.com email I would have to go into Gmail and add the events to my Google calendar.

I came across a few solutions that involved creating a new Google account with your Hey.com email address, however I wanted to keep my existing Google account and calendar and not create a separate one for my hey.com email. 

This guide will help you setup your Hey.com email as an alias for your existing Google account, so anyone can send you a calendar invite to your hey.com email and it will automatically show up on your Google calendar.

You can add your hey email as an alternative email to your gmail account and any google calendar invites sent to your Hey.com email will appear as if your gmail was invited.Â 

### Solution

**Step 1.** Go to your **Google Account Settings** at https://myaccount.google.com/

**Step 2.** Click on **Personal Info** on the left and click on **Email** in the Contact Info section.

**Step 3.** You should see a section called **Alternative emails**. Add your hey.com email to this.
